Hey everybody, I said at the first Hall meeting I'd be dealing with
the birthday list, so here it finally is:


MANIPULATING ATHENA FOR YOUR CALENDAR NEEDS
- - ------------------------------------------

1) In your .startup.X and/or your .startup.tty files, add the command--
calendar 
2)Create a file called calendar. (emacs is what I do)
Place the following line in it:

#include </afs/athena.mit.edu/activity/other/5west/5Wbday>

(this is the 5west locker, where we keep random stuff)
You will get a message a day or two before the date in your
CONSOLE window. The message will say something like:

October 17 Dough's birthday

NOTE:
You can also place some of your own dates in your calendar
file. The format should be similar to this:

April 1 Bubby from 6th East's birthday
OR EVEN
December 3 Paper Due
OR EVEN
August 19 Make Dave Dinner

Each entry goes on a new line.
